/* 

This library is intended to control the outputs of a chain of shift registers. 
It uses software PWM to control the duty cycle of all shift register outputs.

This code is optimized for speed: the interrupt duration is minimal, so that 
the load of the interrupt on your program is minimal (or the amount of registers
and brightness levels is maximal. The SPI is used to send data to the shift regisers,
while the CPU is already calculating the next byte to send out.

Timer1 (16 bit) is used, unless it is already in use by the servo library. 
Then, timer2 (8 bit) will be configured as the interrupt timer, with a prescaler for 
the highest possible precision.

A timer interrupt is configured by ShiftPWM.Start(pwmFrequency,maxBrightness)
The interrupt frequency is set to pwmFrequency * (maxBrightness+1)
Each interrupt all duty cycles are compared to the counter and the corresponding pin
is written 1 or 0 based on the result. Then the counter is increased by one.

The duration of the interrupt depends on the number of shift registers (N).
T = 97 + 43*N (worst case)

The load of the interrupt function on your program can be calculated:
L = Interrupt frequency * interrupt duration / clock frequency
L = F*(Bmax+1)*(97+43*N)/F_CPU 
The duration also depends on the number of brightness levels, but the impact is minimal.


The following functions are used:

ShiftPWM.Start(int ledFrequency, int max_Brightness)		Enable ShiftPWM with desired frequency and brightness levels
SetAmountOfRegisters(int newAmount)						Set or change the amount of output registers. Can be changed at runtime.
PrintInterruptLoad(void)									Print information on timer usage, frequencies and interrupt load
void OneByOne(void)										Fade in and fade out all outputs slowly
void OneByOneFast(void)									Fade in and fade out all outputs fast
void SetOne(int pin, unsigned char value)					Set the duty cycle of one output
void SetAll(unsigned char value)							Set all outputs to the same duty cycle

SetGroupOf2(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1);
SetGroupOf3(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1, unsigned char v2);
SetGroupOf4(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1, unsigned char v2, unsigned char v3);
SetGroupOf5(int group, unsigned char v0, unsigned char v1, unsigned char v2, unsigned char v3, unsigned char v4);
--> Set a group of outputs to the given values. SetGroupOf3 is useful for RGB LED's. Each LED will be a group.
