VIZZable 2.0.4b

Robert Jarvis ZEALOUSY.COM


//Requirements
Ableton Live 9 (32 bit only) and Max for Live 6.1 
Windows also requires the 32 bit version of quicktime
Live 8 and max 6 works but is not officially supported by Ableton



//Installation
Place VIZZable folder anywhere on your hard drive.  Drag plugins from
the Ableton browser or your file system, into your live set.


//Tips
All the plugins have help associated in lives built-in help thingo. When
using the suprPlayr, drag videos in from your operating systems file
browser, not the ableton browser.  Files should be in quicktime format. 
A good rule of thumb is to use the photoJPEG codec at 74% for the best
comprimise between quality and performance.


//Thanks
Chris Gough for his fantastic auto-connect system, preview windows and
chain router device. Mike Todd, Fabrizio Poce, Leon Trimble, Ned Rush
and everyone on the JitterInMax4Live group for their knowledge and
enthusiasm. David Avila for his fantastic JS objects used in the
Suprplayr. Stefan Brunner for his keen bug squashing. Wesley Smith for
pouring his brain out on the cycling 74 forums. Sam Tarakajian for his
unbelievably useful tutorials (http://www.youtube.com/dude837)


//Else
Note to syphon users. Due to a bug in Max, I’m not able to bake syphon
into these devices. If you’d like to harness syphon, you can by
downloading and installing the syphon plugins for Max from here:
http://syphon.v002.info/ and using the unfrozen VIEWR and SYPHR devices
in the syphonplugs folder included in the VIZZable zip.
