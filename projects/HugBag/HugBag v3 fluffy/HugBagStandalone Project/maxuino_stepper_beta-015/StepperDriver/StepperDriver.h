/*
  StepperDriver is a modification of Stepper.cpp that adds
  non-blocking capability and is focused on Stepper Motor Drivers using STEP and DIR pins. 
  As long as you call update() often, you don't have to wait for the stepper to complete its movement
  before you can make other function calls. Update also does a return when the steps are complete.

  The original stepper.cpp v0.4 notes:
  
  Stepper.h - - Stepper library for Wiring/Arduino - Version 0.4
  
  Original library     (0.1) by Tom Igoe.
  Two-wire modifications   (0.2) by Sebastian Gassner
  Combination version   (0.3) by Tom Igoe and David Mellis
  Bug fix for four-wire   (0.4) by Tom Igoe, bug fix from Noah Shibley
  Non-blocking code by Rob Seward in 2009, it's based off of Stepper.cpp version 0.4
  Alterations for Stepper Driver Boards and no interuption by Chris Coleman 2011
